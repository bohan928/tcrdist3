Sparse Representation
=====================


For large datasets, you may want to set compute_distances to False and then use a sparse implementation. 
First, set ``tr.cpus`` as appropriate to your system. When computing distances with the sparse implementation, the argument ``radius`` is the maximum distance to be stored. All distances greater than ``radius`` will be converted to 0, reducing the memory required in a sparse format. The argument ``chunk_size`` tells tcrdist3 how many rows to compute at a time. For instance, if you have 100,000 x 100,000 clones, then a chunk size of 100 will compute distances 100x100,000 on each node and store each of the 1000 intermediate results in a sparse format before recombining them it a single sparse ``scipy.sparse.csr_matrix``. Larger chunk sizes will result in less overhead, but chunk size should be tuned based on available memory. The results are object attributes ``rw_beta`` and ``rw_alpha``. True 0 distances are represented as -1. The techniques for customizing the distance metric such as changing trims, gap when using the sparse implementation.
